(*): Running "Simple Run blocker" without extracting it and selecting "Block all except the List below" 
feature causes undo problem , This is a typical wrong usage of Simple Run blocker , but users keep to doing it 
to awoid that , we have copied "Simple Run Blocker" into the Program files and created  a desktop shortcut ( Only 
if you select "Block all except the List below" feature) , you can control this feature with editing  RunBlock.ini file :
CopyToProgramFiles=1 (Default usage like above explanation)
CopyToProgramFiles=0 (Disable the Shortcut creation feature)
If you choose second or third features , Simple Run Blocker folder and the Shortcut will automatically 
deleted , you can control this with changing the following values
RemoveFromProgramFiles=1 (Default usage like above explanation)
RemoveFromProgramFiles=0 (Disable auto removing feature)
